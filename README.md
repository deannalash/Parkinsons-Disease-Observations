Data Curation, Winter 2021

Hello Data Curation Classmates!

The first file in my repository is my dataset description based on the article and research "Effect of On-Demand Cueing on Freezing of Gait
in Parkinsonâ€™s Patients". This files is a brief description of a 2012 study of Parkinson's Disease patients experiencing 'FOG' or freezing of gait episodes where the patient is stuck in a tremor or cannot walk properly. The assignment describes the dataset, provides feedback for minor improvements in the article, as weell as the current creative commons licensing.
