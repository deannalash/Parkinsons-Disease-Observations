#Parkinsons-Disease-Observations
Data Curation, Winter 2021

Hello Data Curation Classmates!

The first file in my repository is my dataset description based on the article and research "Effect of On-Demand Cueing on Freezing of Gait
in Parkinson’s Patients". This files is a brief description of a 2012 study of Parkinson's Disease patients experiencing 'FOG' or freezing of gait episodes where the patient is stuck in a tremor or cannot walk properly. The assignment describes the dataset, provides feedback for minor improvements in the article, as weell as the current creative commons licensing. However, per my classmate's review this file was removed and reuploaded under the name "Data and Metadata Profile".

The second file in my repository describes the proposed repository that I believe would be the best fit for my previous dataset assignment.
The Michael J. Fox Foundation has a research repository for medical professionals who are working to cure Parkinson's Disease. Often referred to as, FoxDen, this repository holds all research and observations pertaining to Parkinson's disease. A login is required gain access to the full repository, but patients are encouraged to record their own experiences here as well. However, per my classmate's review this file was removed and reuploaded under the name "Repository Profile".

Fig.1 - This is a pdf that shows the course laid out for the patients to walk through. Tasks that the patients were asked to perform throughout the course are also denoted.

Fig.2 - This pdf is a graph that shows how the patients scored throughout the experiment. The graph compares patient evaluations of sensory cues with results from measuring the durration of a "FOG" episode.

Table I - A pdf of Table 1 in the article; "Summary of Patient Characteristics"

Table II - A csv of Table 2 in the article; "Description of Used Sensory Cues"

Table III - A pdf of Table 3 in the article; "Mean and Standard Deviation of Duration of Freezing Episodes in Seconds of Patients in Different Cueing Conditions"

Table IV - A csv of Table 4 in the article; "Point Score Given by Patients to the Different Cues Concerning Their Effectiveness to Reduce FOG Duration."

A note on ethics of human subjects as data:
Due to the anonymity of each patient in the data set, where no descriptive data is included except for the symptoms of Parkinson's Disease, this dataset is considered very low-risk. This study was closely followed up with the code of ethics as established by Comité Ético de Investigación Clínica debEuskadi, and therefore it can be deduced that this was reviewed by a board. Patients were asked to sign a waiver stating the intent of this data.
